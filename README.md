# SAR Image Colorization using Deep Learning

This project focuses on the task of automatically colorizing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using deep learning techniques. SAR is an active remote sensing system that captures images with unique properties, often resulting in grayscale outputs that differ significantly from optical imagery, which is passive and relies on reflected light. A key challenge in SAR imagery is speckle noise, which arises from the interference of returning radar signals.

Converting SAR images to color can enhance their interpretability and facilitate fusion with optical data. This project explores and implements various deep learning models and techniques for this purpose, aiming to create a custom solution by leveraging feature extraction, transfer learning, and feature fusion. The process involves training models to learn the complex mapping from SAR image characteristics to realistic color representations, often using paired SAR and optical images as training data.

## Features

*   **Deep Learning Models:** Implementation and experimentation with several deep learning architectures suitable for image-to-image translation tasks, including U-Net, Pix2Pix, CycleGAN, cGAN4ColSAR, Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), and a Multi-scale fusion network.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Incorporation of feature extraction, transfer learning, and feature fusion techniques to potentially improve colorization quality, particularly for a custom Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model.
*   **Data Preprocessing Pipeline:** Tools for loading, normalizing, augmenting, and applying post-processing techniques like histogram matching to SAR and optical image pairs.
*   **Training Scripts:** Modular scripts for training individual models and potentially a fused multi-model approach.
*   **Evaluation Framework:** Scripts to evaluate the performance of colorization models using standard image quality metrics.
*   **Configuration Management:** Use of YAML configuration files for managing model hyperparameters and training settings.
*   **Structured Repository:** Organized file structure for data, models, preprocessing, training, evaluation, results, and configurations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

*   **Python:** A working Python environment.
*   **Deep Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow and/or PyTorch are required for model implementation and training. Keras may also be used for prototyping.
*   **Image Processing Libraries:** OpenCV and Scikit-image for various image manipulation tasks.
*   **Data Manipulation Libraries:** NumPy and Pandas are used for handling image data arrays and potentially dataset information (like CSV mappings).
*   *(Optional)* MATLAB can be useful for initial testing and model design.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd SAR_Image_Colorization_Project
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have `pip` installed and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This will install all required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Data

*   The project requires a dataset consisting of **paired SAR and optical images**. These pairs are crucial for training the deep learning models to learn the relationship between SAR data and color information from optical images.
*   Relevant datasets include **Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery** (e.g., the SEN12MS dataset) and potentially **SpaceNet 6** data.
*   Organize your dataset within the `data/` directory as specified in the project structure:
    *   `data/sar/`: Contains grayscale SAR images.
    *   `data/optical/`: Contains the corresponding optical images (ground truth).
    *   `train.csv`, `val.csv`, `test.csv`: CSV files mapping SAR images to their corresponding optical images for training, validation, and testing.

## Usage

The main entry point for the project pipeline is `main.py`. This script orchestrates the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation phases based on the specified configurations in the `configs/` directory.

To run the full pipeline using a specific model configuration:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/model_config.yaml
```

*(Note: The exact command and available arguments for `main.py` depend on its implementation, but the structure implies configuration-driven execution.)*

You can modify the YAML files in `configs/` to adjust hyperparameters, model choices, dataset paths, and other settings.
